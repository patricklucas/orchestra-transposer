# orchestra-transposer

Converts between a FIX Orchestra file and other artifacts.

The initial implementation converts between Orchestra version 1.0 and these other XML schemas:
* Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) version 1.0
* FIX Unified Repository 2010 Edition

### FIX standards and schemas
References for these standards and their XML schemas are available in GitHub.

[Orchestra](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra)
The XSD files for Orchestra are in module `repository` while the Unified Repository schema is in
module `repository2010`.

[Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding)
Currently version 1.0 is supported.


## Features

* Validate an Orchestra file against its XML schema.
* Access elements of an Orchestra file in "pythonic" data structures that are aware of XML Schema
datatypes.
* Validate an SBE message schema against its XML schema.
* Access elements of an SBE message schema in "pythonic" data structures that are aware of XML
Schema datatypes.
* Convert an Orchestra file to an SBE message schema. Support datatype customization.
* Convert an SBE message schema to an Orchestra file.
* Validate a Unified Repository file against its schema.
* Convert an Orchestra file to a Unified Repository.
* Convert a Unified Repository to an Orchestra file.

## Prerequisites

Requires [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) or later. (Earlier
versions have not been tested.)

Unit tests use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) framework.

Assuming that Python and pip are already installed, get started as follows:
1. Clone this Git repository
2. In the working directory, create a Python virtual environment, e.g. `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Install required dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. For development of this project, also install dependencies from `requirements-dev.txt`. This is required for
documentation generation and possibly other tasks.

### Documentation
To generate documentation, invoke the make utility in the `docs` directory.

## Usage

See the pytest test cases in the `tests` directory for examples of programmatic usage.


### Command line usage

A command line interface is provided by script `orchestratransposer.py`.

The arguments are patterned after Pandoc.

```
usage: orchestratransposer.py [OPTION]...

Convert an Orchestra XML file to or from another schema

positional arguments:
  input                 Name of input file(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -o OUTPUT [OUTPUT ...], --output OUTPUT [OUTPUT ...]
                        name of output file(s)
  -f {orch,unif,sbe}, --from {orch,unif,sbe}
                        format of source file: Orchestra 1.0, Unified Repository, or SBE 1.0
  -t {orch,unif,sbe}, --to {orch,unif,sbe}
                        format of output file: Orchestra 1.0, Unified Repository, or SBE 1.0
```

Log messages are written to a file with the same path as the output file but with '.log' extension.

First example translates an Orchestra file to SBE.
```
python3 orchestratransposer.py tests/xml/OrchestraFIXLatest.xml --to sbe -o sbe_test.xml
```

Second example translates an Orchestra file to a Unified Repository
Two file names needed, starting with the name of the repository file.
```
python3 orchestratransposer.py tests/xml/OrchestraFIXLatest.xml --to unif -o Repository.xml Phrases.xml
```
